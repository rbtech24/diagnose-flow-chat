# Components Missing API Implementation

After reviewing the codebase, here are the components and features that currently don't have proper API implementation:

1. **Tech Calendar Feature**
   - The Quick Links in TechDashboard have a Calendar link, but the calendar page and its API implementation are missing.

2. **Tech Notifications**
   - The link to notifications preferences exists, but the page and API implementation are missing.

3. **Training Materials Section**
   - Links to training guides, videos, and certification programs exist in the Tech Dashboard, but these pages and their API implementations are missing.

4. **Knowledge Base**
   - Referenced in the Resources section but missing implementation.

5. **useCompanyTechnicians Hook**
   - Has TypeScript type instantiation issues that need to be fixed.

6. **subscriptionStore.ts**
   - Has API integration issues with non-existent database tables.

7. **featureRequestsApi.ts**
   - Has some null safety issues with user data.

## Recommended Next Steps:

1. Implement the missing pages for:
   - Tech Calendar
   - Tech Notifications
   - Training Materials
   - Knowledge Base

2. Fix the type issues in useCompanyTechnicians hook

3. Complete proper API integration for subscriptionStore.ts, ensuring database tables exist

4. Add more robust null checks in API integration files like featureRequestsApi.ts
