# Components Missing API Implementation (UPDATED)

After removing the hardcoded mock data files, the following UI features still need proper API implementation:

1. **Tech Notifications**
   - The link to notifications preferences exists, but robust API is still missing.

2. **Training Materials Section**
   - Links to training guides, videos, and certification programs exist in the Tech Dashboard, but full data integration is pending.

3. **Knowledge Base**
   - Referenced in the Resources section but not fully implemented.

4. **useCompanyTechnicians Hook**
   - Has TypeScript type instantiation issues that should be checked.

5. **subscriptionStore.ts**
   - Has API integration issues with non-existent database tables.

6. **featureRequestsApi.ts**
   - Needs more robust null safety for user data.

## Recommended Next Steps

- Implement the missing pages/APIs for Tech Notifications, Training Materials, and Knowledge Base.
- Fix types and API integration for the listed hooks and stores.
